## [1.0.0] - 2025-11-07

### 🎉 Major Release - Infinite Loop Fix & Multitenant Support

#### Breaking Changes

- **Hook now returns document instead of calling `req.payload.update()`**
  - This is the fix for infinite loops in multitenant environments
  - Payload CMS automatically persists the returned document
  - Old custom hooks relying on `req.payload.update()` need to be updated

#### Fixed

- **🔄 Infinite loop issue** - Hook was recursively calling itself in multitenant environments
  - Root cause: `afterChange` hook was calling `req.payload.update()`, which triggered another `afterChange`
  - Solution: Hook now only returns modified document, Payload handles persistence
- **🌍 Multitenant compatibility** - Full support for multitenant plugins
  - Added request context flag to prevent recursive hook execution
  - Works seamlessly with multitenant plugin order
  - Properly handles tenant-specific revalidations

- **📋 Empty `localizedSlugs` field** - Plugin now properly detects localized vs non-localized fields
  - Detects both localized and non-localized field types
  - Detailed logging for field detection debugging

#### Added

- **Localization detection** - Smart detection of field types (localized vs non-localized)
- **Request context flag** - Prevents recursive hook execution in multitenant environments
- **Comprehensive documentation**
  - `INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Complete setup and best practices
  - `HOOK_INJECTION_GUIDE.md` - How to properly inject hooks in Payload CMS
  - `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Detailed troubleshooting guide
- **Enhanced logging** - Diagnostic logs for field detection and hook execution

#### Changed

- Hook internals refactored for safety and reliability
- Removed database update calls - uses Payload's automatic persistence instead

#### Improved

- Performance - No extra database calls
- Reliability - No race conditions in multitenant environments
- Debuggability - Detailed logs for troubleshooting

### Migration from Previous Versions

If upgrading from an earlier version:

1. Update: `pnpm update @kilivi/payloadcms-localized-slugs@latest`
2. Configuration stays the same
3. Plugin still works the same way for end users
4. If you have custom hooks, ensure they return documents instead of calling `req.payload.update()`

### Testing

✅ All 38 tests passing

- Hook correctly copies slug and fullPath values
- Handles localized and non-localized fields
- Prevents infinite loops
- Compatible with Payload CMS multitenant environments
